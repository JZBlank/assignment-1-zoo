        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Tigers are one of the most magnificent and captivating animals on the planet.
           They are large carnivorous cats known for their distinctive orange fur with black stripes, powerful build, and sharp claws. 
           Tigers are native to Asia, where they can be found in various habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands. 
           The largest of all big cat species, tigers can grow up to 11 feet in length and weigh up to 600 pounds. 
           Despite their size, they are known for their agility and speed, making them efficient hunters. 
           Sadly, tigers are now considered an endangered species, with only about 4,000 individuals remaining in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching.
           Conservation efforts are underway to protect these majestic animals and preserve their populations for future generations to admire and appreciate.

        <h1>Diet</h1>
        
        <p>Tigers are carnivores and their diet consists mainly of large prey, such as deer, wild pigs, and buffalo. 
          They are also known to hunt smaller animals such as monkeys, birds, and fish. 
          Tigers are solitary hunters and will hunt their prey alone. 
          They use their powerful muscles, sharp claws, and strong jaws to capture and kill their prey, often using their powerful bite to crush the animal's spinal cord. 
          Tigers are capable of taking down much larger prey than themselves and can consume up to 90 pounds of meat in a single meal. 
          They are known to be opportunistic hunters, and will also scavenge for food when prey is scarce. 
          However, with their declining populations, tigers are facing a lack of food in their habitats, which is leading to increased conflict with humans who live nearby.
