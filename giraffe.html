        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Giraffes are majestic and long-necked mammals native to Africa. 
          They are the tallest land animals in the world, with their long legs and neck making them tower over most other animals, reaching heights of up to 18 feet.
          Giraffes have a distinctive pattern of brown patches on a light background, with each giraffe having a unique pattern, much like human fingerprints. 
          They are herbivores and feed on leaves, buds, and fruits from trees, using their long necks to reach vegetation that other animals cannot.
          Their tongue is also exceptionally long, about 18 inches, and is used to grip and pluck leaves from branches. 
          Giraffes are also known for their speed, and can run up to 35 miles per hour, making them difficult for predators to catch. 
          However, their populations have declined in recent years due to habitat loss and hunting for their hides, bones, and tails, which are considered valuable. 
          Conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve giraffe populations, so future generations can continue to admire these fascinating creatures.

        <h1>Diet</h1>
        
        <p>Giraffes are herbivores and feed mainly on leaves, buds, and fruits of trees. 
          Their long necks allow them to reach vegetation that other animals cannot, and their tongue, which is about 18 inches long, helps them pluck leaves from branches. 
          They feed primarily on the leaves of acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees, as well as various other trees and shrubs. 
          Giraffes have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough and woody vegetation. 
          They feed for most of the day, consuming up to 75 pounds of vegetation. 
          Giraffes are known to be selective feeders, and have been observed trying different types of vegetation before settling on their preferred food. 
          In some areas, they have to compete with other herbivores for food, and in times of scarcity, they may have to travel long distances in search of food. 
          Giraffes are also known to feed on bark and branches when leaves are scarce.
