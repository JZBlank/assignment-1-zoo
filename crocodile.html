        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Crocodiles are large, predatory reptiles that have inhabited the earth for over 200 million years. 
          They belong to the family Crocodylidae and are found in tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. 
          Crocodiles have powerful jaws and sharp teeth, making them excellent hunters and formidable predators. 
          They are known to ambush their prey and drag them into the water where they use their strength and size to overcome them. 
          Crocodiles are highly adaptable and can live in both salt and fresh water. 
          They have a tough, scaly hide that provides protection from predators and helps regulate their body temperature. 
          Despite their fearsome reputation, crocodiles play an important role in their ecosystems, serving as top predators and helping to control populations of smaller animals.

        <h1>Diet</h1>
        
        <p>Crocodiles are opportunistic predators and feed on a wide variety of prey. 
          Their diet primarily consists of fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals. 
          In particular, young crocodiles feed on insects, crustaceans, and small fish, while adult crocodiles feed on larger prey such as antelopes, buffalos, zebras, and even smaller crocodiles.
          In some cases, crocodiles have been known to attack and kill humans who venture too close to their territory. 
          They use their powerful jaws and sharp teeth to grasp and tear their prey, and they swallow their food whole if it is small enough. 
          Crocodiles are capable of going for long periods of time without food and can survive on just one large meal for several months.
