        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Brown bears are large omnivores native to North America, Europe, and Asia. 
          They are also known as grizzly bears and are typically recognized by their shaggy fur, which ranges in color from blonde to nearly black. 
          Brown bears are opportunistic feeders and their diet can include anything from berries and roots, to small mammals and fish. 
          They are also known for their powerful builds, with males weighing on average between 200 to 600 pounds and females weighing between 100 to 400 pounds. 
          Brown bears are apex predators and play an important role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem. 
          However, due to human activities such as habitat destruction and hunting, their populations have declined in many areas, and they are now considered a threatened species in some regions.
        </p>
        <h1>Diet</h1>
        
        <p>Brown bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. 
          Their diet can vary depending on where they live and what is available to them. 
          Brown bears are also known to scavenge and will feed on carrion (dead animals) when the opportunity arises. 
          They are opportunistic feeders and their diet can change depending on the availability of food sources. 
          In areas where food is abundant, such as in salmon streams, brown bears will often focus their diet on fish, while in other areas they may feed more on berries and plants.
